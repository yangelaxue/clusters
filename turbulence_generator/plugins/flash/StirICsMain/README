This is the collection of source code files used in the FLASH hydro code for generating initial turbulent velocity and magnetic fields.

It uses the C++ implementation of TurbGen.h with Fortran (with a Fortran-to-C interface in st_stirics_TurbGen_interface.C) to construct a single realisation of a turbulent vector field.

This code can be used as a template for other hydro codes. Short description of main files:

- StirICs_data.F90 contains shared data for the FLASH module.
- StirICs_init.F90 initialises the turbulent initial conditions module.
- StirICs.F90 is the main source code that generates turbulent velocity or magnetic fields as initial conditions, by calling functions in st_stirics_TurbGen_interface.C.
- st_stirics_TurbGen_interface.C is the Fortran-to-C interface to access functions in TurbGen.h.
- Config is the FLASH internal module configuration file.
